# Share data between forms
In situations where you need a large object but your forms are split into different views, like in a checkout process, you typically use some form of store management logic.

Iâ€™ve solved this problem by allowing data to be shared between forms.

To make this work, you need to do two things: set the `name` and `preserve` options in `useForm` hook.

`SharedForm.vue`
::: code-group
```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { useForm } from 'vue-formify';

const { Form, Field, handleSubmit } = useForm<{username: string; password: string;}>({
	name: 'shared-form',
	preserved: true,
});
const sendForm = handleSubmit((data)) => {
	console.log(data);
};

</script>
<template>
	<Form @submit="sendForm">
		<Field name="first_name" />
		<Field name="last_name" />
		<button>Send</button>
	</Form>
</template>
```
:::
`Template.vue`
::: code-group
```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { SharedForm } from './SharedForm.vue';

const toggle = ref<boolean>(false)
</script>
<template>
	<div>
		<SharedForm v-if="toggle" />
		<SharedForm v-else />
		<button type="button" @click="toggle = !toggle">
			Toggle between forms
		</button>
	</div>
</template>
```
:::
If you fill the inputs and toggle between the form the values stays the same.
```json
{
    "first_name": "Foo",
    "last_name": "Bar",
}
```
:::tip Importance of `name` and `preserve`
It's important to use the same `name` and use `preserve` to make it work. The `name` identifies the form and `preserve` prevent the value removed when the component is unmounted.
